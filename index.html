       <h3>Unity Engine upgrade</h3>
       <p>The latest preview shows off quite a few new features which are not adding a lot of content but have been long awaited changes to the game, the main one being the move from Unit 4 to Unity 5 meaning that the capability of the base game has been expanded massively, the engine upgrade means that there will be less crashing and also better performance overall.</p>
       <br>
       <h3>UI Completely remade</h3>
       <p>The original UI Had been in the game since the very start and they way it was functioning was no where near as optimized as it could be, the engine upgrade forced the team to remake the UI, fixing all the issues they've been unable to do all this time.</p>
       <br>
       <h3>Wheel Physics</h3>
       <p>The wheels in the game have been know to be very glitchy and unstable but that should be no more as the physics for them had to be completly remade inorder to get them to function in the new engine, this means that some of the asked for features have been implemented into the physics and an example of this is now that the wheels can slip and cause a vehicle to slide if it loses traction, this means that people can create more interesting designs like drift cars and the such.</p>
